        <h2 id="bio"> ABOUT ME </h2>
<pre>    Rajdeep Singh and I am a gaming enthusiast. 
    I was born and brought up in a nuclear family of Punjab, India, and have come to Canada to pursue the Game Programming Course, which would enable me to make a multi-billion game. 
    Apart from video games, I have keen interest in playing table tennis. I was a district champion of Table-Tennis, but unfortunatly Covid came,
    which resisted me from practicing as I only had one place to practice and that was school, 
    but school were shut down. So, when schools were fully reopened, 
    I had graduated and didn't had access to practice in school.
    But now as I have joined SLC for my studies, 
    there is a table for ping pong and I can play and practice as much as I want to regain my form I had lost during covid.
    Moreover, I have to stay healthy during my stay here in Canada because <q><i>Winter is Coming</i></q>.</pre>
